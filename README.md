# React Task App using Local Storage

This task app allows you to create tasks by displaying them in a table. We can also mark them as done and they will be shown in another table of tasks done. We can hide this last table or delete all its completed tasks. Task data remains persistent even if you refresh the web thanks to the use of local storage. This application is styled with bootstrap.
